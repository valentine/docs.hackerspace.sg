### Membership Addons

#### Lockers 

HackerspaceSG offers three sizes of lockers for rental to members. Big lockers (42cm) are SGD15 per month, small lockers (28cm) are SGD10 per month, and tiny lockers (21cm) are SGD7.50 per month.

#### Open Storage

Members receive 22L of free storage for every $64 SGD of monthly membership subscription, and can rent additional storage at $5 SGD per 22L. For example, Community members paying $128 a month get 44L of free storage.

Please subscribe to additional storage whether you're using HackerspaceSG's supplied boxes, your own storage containers (e.g. suitcases), or storing large individual items (e.g. bicycles) at the premises. HackerspaceSG admin will be in touch if we believe that you should enter into a subscription.

For HackerspaceSG boxes, storage rental is billed whether the boxes are in HackerspaceSG or elsewhere. Boxes should be returned in reusable condition when you end your subscription term. If a box is damaged or missing, a replacement fee will be billed at $12 per 22L box, and $25 per 44L box. The replacement fee will be waived if you've paid 12 months of storage subscription for that box.

Open storage is offered subject to space availability, and allocations may be terminated (with notice) if we do not have enough space. We're not looking to enter the self-service storage business. HackerspaceSG admin may move boxes and other stored items at our discretion, especially if they get in the way of normal activities.

#### Mailing Address for Businesses

Businesses may use HackerspaceSG's address to receive physical/snail mail, as long as they are associated with a member.

Members at the Co-working ($256) tier and above may register one business to receive mail free.

Community and Concessionary members may register their businesses at $10 SGD per business per month.

## Personal Belongings

Members are invited to leave their stuff at the Hackerspace, with the understanding that other members and guests may [use, handle, break and discard them](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/The_Old_Hardware_Pattern). This includes, but is not limited to: computers, keyboards, mice, chargers, furniture, and toys. Please label your items.

Please clear all personal belongings from your desk when you leave Hackerspace for the day. (This doesn't apply to the desks and personal belongings of members who are subscribed to the Dedicated tier.) Please be considerate to fellow members and guests.

HackerspaceSG will not be held responsible for any loss or damage of personal belongings.

[^1]: We used to have a physical [membership form](https://hackerspace.sg/membership/MembershipAgreement.pdf), but are gradually deprecating it.

[^2]: "Unlimited" means a normal working schedule of 10â€“12 hours a day, though we won't kick up a fuss if you go over by a little. Members are generally [not allowed to use the space as a residence](rules#overnight).
